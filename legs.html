                    Sit on an upright bench holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height with your palms facing
                    away from you. Keep your chest up and your core braced, and look straight forward throughout the
                    move. Press the weights directly upwards until your arms are straight and the weights touch above
                    your head. Slowly lower the weights back to the start position under control, pause, then start the
                    next rep. Bouncing back up from the bottom position places greater strain on your shoulders and
                    means youâ€™re using momentum to move the weights instead of your muscles.

                            <b>How to perform Dumbbell side raises:</b>
                            The side lateral raise is an effective shoulder-strengthening movement designed to isolate
                            the lateral head of the deltoid muscle. Performed regularly, this can help you develop
                            stronger, broader shoulders. All you need is a pair of light dumbbells and enough shoulder
                            flexibility to abduct your arms (lifting the weights out and away from your body) until they
                            form a "T" shape at your shoulders.

                    <b>How to perform Reverse pec deck:</b>
                    Sit down on the reverse fly machine facing the weight stack and get the seat in the position that
                    allows you to grab the handles so your hands are in line with your elbows and shoulders.
                    Position the handles so they are as far back towards the weight stack as possible. They should be
                    together on the last setting.
                    Keep your shoulders down, chest up, and torso upright with your chest glued to the pad.
                    Push with the side of your hands and pull your arms back until you feel a contraction in your upper
                    back and rear delt.
                    The end of the ROM your arms are outstretched at the side of your body and focus on squeezing the
                    rear delts. You can pause and squeeze the targeted muscles here if you like for greater contraction.
                    Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.

                            Lower the dumbbells to the starting position (at the thighs) with a slow and controlled

                    Stand at a squatting station with your feet positioned roughly shoulder-width apart and your toes
                    angled slightly outward.
                    Duck beneath the weighted bar so that it rests across the back of your shoulders.
                    Press up while keeping your back and neck as straight as possible, lifting the bar from the station.
                    Bend your knees until your thighs are just about parallel to the floor so that your hip joints are
                    lower than your knees.
                    Slowly raise your body back up until you are in the starting posture.
                    Tips: Keep your body and core tight throughout the entire movement. Get your form nailed down before
                    you start adding weight to the bar.

                            Sit in a leg press machine and place your feet onto the footplate. Your feet should be
                            spread roughly hip-width apart.
                            Unlock the safety lever and allow the weight to lower towards you until your knees are bent
                            at roughly a 90-degree angle.
                            With your back pressed firmly against the seat, exhale while you press the weight away until
                            your legs are completely straight.
                            Slowly lower the weight back down into the starting position and repeat.
                            Tips: To make the exercise more challenging, you can try doing single-leg presses or
                            elevated leg presses.

                    Stand on a linear press machine and recline with your back against the rest. Slide your shoulders
                    under the shoulder pads and position your feet roughly shoulder-width apart. If there are handles in
                    place, grip the handles with your elbows facing forward.
                    Bend your knees and lower through your hips until your knees are at roughly a 90-degree angle.
                    Keeping your back straight, press up through your heels to raise the weight back up into the
                    starting position.
                    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
                    Tips: Be sure to lower your legs until they are slightly below parallel with the floor. This is
                    where you'll experience the best results.

                            Choose a weight that you can comfortably manage and grip the handles, if available.
                            Keeping your back straight, exhale as you extend your legs forward until they are straight.
                            Pause for a count of two and then slowly lower the weight back down into its starting
                            position.

                    <b>How to perform Leg Curl:</b>
                    Adjust the length of the machine so that your knees are in line with the pivot point and the backs
                    of your legs are placed under the padded levers.
                    Adjust the weight to something you can comfortably manage and hold the handles, if available.
                    With your back straight, curl your legs up towards your glutes while exhaling through the motion.
                    Take a second or two to pause, and then slowly lower the weight back down until you are in the
                    starting position again.
                    Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.
                    Tips: This motion can feel awkward if you're new to the exercise. Start with a lighter weight and
                    increase over time as you become more comfortable with the movement.

                            <b>To perform Lunges:</b>
                            Start by standing with your feet together and your hands down by your sides.
                            Step forward with one leg and lower your body towards the floor by bending both knees.
                            Your front knee should be at roughly a 90-degree angle, and your back knee should be close
                            to the floor but not resting on it.
                            From here, push off your front leg and return to the starting position as if you were taking
                            a step.
                            Repeat the exercise with your other leg.
                            Tips: To make this exercise more challenging, try holding dumbbells in each hand or holding
                            a barbell across your shoulders. You can also move forward through the exercise to make it
                            more dynamic.

                    <b>How to perform Standing calf raises:</b>
                    Get positioned on an exercise step or a weight plate to create a full range of motion for this
                    movement.
                    Stand with your feet placed together, and have the ball of your foot rest on the edge of the
                    exercise step or weight plate.
                    Hold your hands down by your sides. You may hold a dumbbell in each hand for additional weight.
                    Proceed to raise your body up onto your toes.
                    Lower your body back down into the starting posture.
                    Tips: As with lunges, you can also move forward through the exercise to make it more dynamic.

                            Take a seat on the machine and place the balls of your feet on the platform with your toes
                            pointed forward - your heels will naturally hang off. Position the base of quads under the
                            knee pad and allow your hands to rest on top.
                            Extend your ankles and release the safety bar.
                            Lower the heels by dorsiflexing the ankles until the calves are fully stretched.
                            Extend the ankles and exhale as you flex the calves.
                            Repeat for the assigned number of repetitions.
